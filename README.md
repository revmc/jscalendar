jscalendar
==========

This was a code project that I got from a prospective employer.  The instructions were as follows:

Using only raw JavaScript Create a Calendar class that renders a calendar with the following requirements:

* User can change months with the arrow icons and keyboard keys
* The current day is highlighted on calendar
* By default, the current day is shown in the left pane
* On click, the left pane should update with the clicked date
* It should appear similar to the wireframe version below (it doesnâ€™t need to be perfect).
* _Styling is not a requirement._ Styling is optional if you regard HTML/CSS as one of your strengths.

Here's the mockup that I got:
